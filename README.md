This Repo consists of three core notebooks and a zipped csv file.


Data Cleaning.ipynb:

This file contains all of the data cleaning and saves the CSV that will be used to create our models.


Visualizations.ipynb:

This file contains some basic descriptive visualizations that enable the user to get a holistic picture of what is contained in an HMDA data pull.


Random Forest Model.ipynb:

This file contains the code to create Random Forest models on the CSV resulting from the Data Cleaning notebook.  These models were not used for our final analysis, but are discussed in the paper.


rob_decision_tree.ipynb:

This file contains the code to create a decision tree, which contains the final specification that was used in our presentation.


Steps to Replicate Analysis:

Open data cleaning, run all cells.  A file will be saved in your working directory.

Open Random Forest Model, run all cells.  Random Forest specifications considered will be displayed.

Open rob_decision_tree, run all cells.  Our final model used will appear in this file.
